    <br><h2>ABOUT THE TEAM</h2>
   <h3> <p>Cognito means that one's existence is demonstrated by the fact that one thinks.Cognito is an initiative by the students of IGDTUW, aiming to promote UN Sustainable Development Goals 8 & 9.
    We believe in Fostering innovation, promoting inclusive economic growth and developing a versatile infrastructure for the generations, without compromising on the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
    We, a team of 17, believe in the Cognito way of thinking and making change happen.
     </p></h3>
    <br><h2>ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN- COMPUTE TO SUSTAIN</h2>
<h3><p>
  Compute To Sustain is an awareness campaign that will undertake exciting activities like 'Sustainable Sundays', Ideathons and offline campaigns to enlighten people about green computing. It is an initiative towards sensitizing people on how responsible and mindful usage of technology and electronics can lead to a greener, healthier world.
  
  Some of the Successful Events:
  
  <br><br><u><b>1. Sustainable Sundays-</b></u><br>
  
  Sustainable Sundays is an online campaign initiated by Cognito, where we post statistics and data about Green Computing and measures which can be taken by us to promote Green Computing every Sunday.
  Some of our highlighted posts are related to shutting down computers every night, tips to boost the battery life of your android phones, turning off peripherals, and everything you need to know about printers.
  
  <br><br><u><b>2. Ideate to Sustain-</b></u><br>
  
  Ideate2Sustain organized by Cognito in collaboration with GeeksforGeeks Student Chapter IGDTUW took place on April 17, 2022. The Ideathon was a team-based competition on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals as stated by the UN where participants were required to ideate and come up with a solution toward realizing these goals.
  We received over 800 registrations, out of which 150 teams were shortlisted on the basis of the MCQ round. The presentation ideas provided by the shortlisted teams were astonishing. With such brilliant ideas, it was a tough task to shortlist teams for the final round. Nine teams got the opportunity to present their ideas in front of our panelists. The judging criterias were Sustainability and Technology, Innovation and Feasibility, Impact and Completion. The teams provided excellent sustainability solutions. The creativity demonstrated by the participants astounded us.
  
  <br><br><u><b>3. Delete to Sustain-</b></u><br>
  
  In the world of Technology, we are unaware of the number of carbon footprints our gadgets, internet, and video streaming create. With the motive to reduce the number of carbon footprints generated Cognito organized the Delete2Sustain campaign which was an Email Deletion campaign. It took place on 22nd April 2022 through our Twitter Handle (Cognito SDG). This campaign brought an opportunity for all of us to play our part in reducing the carbon footprints generated by our actions. We witnessed the participation of more than 500 students. As we know Spam, unread and unwanted emails all contribute to carbon emissions. If we delete 500 unread emails (assuming they're not important emails), that would delete 175 grams of carbon dioxide given each email contributes 0.3 grams of CO2. Keeping this in mind the
  participants brought the following changes such as: Deleting Spam emails, Unsubscribing from emails they no longer need, deleting emails after reading them and many more.
  
  <br><br><u><b>4. Aware to Sustain-</b></u><br>
  
  In our daily lives, we all use technology. The pandemic has exposed us all to the technological world. However, we frequently overlook the fact that when using technology, we have a responsibility to the environment. Team Cognito decided to organize the Aware2Sustain campaign with the goal of educating
  people about Green Computing. The goal of this event was to raise awareness about Green Computing among persons who work with technologies and related devices on a daily basis. It was intended to educate people on how proper use of their electronic devices may benefit Mother Nature.We invited participants to interview at least one member of their family or friend who is a regular user of technology. They were intended to ask them whether or not they were familiar with the concept of Green Computing and what level of understanding they had. They were then advised to inform them of the situation and enlighten them about the facts of Green Computing so that people begin to use their gadgets more sensibly.
